# Recommender-ranking-system
A project about recommendation system, with ranking algorithms to tackle the cold-start problem

# Introduction
Recommendation system is a hot topic in recent years, here we utilize various AI&ML methods to tackle this problem.

For traditional recommendation methods, aka collaborative filtering, we utilized Singular value decomposition and Alternating Least Square (ALS) Matrix Factorization. Nonetheless, we also tried to implement classical ranking methods to tackle the cold-start problem, which include PageRank, Elo, Elo+KNN, Massey Rating and Average Dominance. 

We also tried content based methods like LightGBM.

# Dataset
Our work can be adopted to benchmark MovieLens and one interesting speed dating data set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/speed-dating).
